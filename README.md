Sci1Page repository consists of comprehensive functions for plotting published figures.

Based on the jupyter notebook, you can plot figures or analyze your data, keeping track of the research progress.

This makes it easier to make the figures styles consistent, also easier to replot the figures if necessary.

The functions will include:

1. XRD patterens
2. Time resolved photoluminescence (plot and fitting) (TRPL)
3. PL emission
4. SKPM
5. Solar cell devcice parameters extraction (Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE)
6. Box plot of Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE
7. JVcurve plot
8. UV-vis
9. perovskite precursor calculator--from PVSK_composition import PVSK

The data folder contains the various data for the exemplary example_Sci1Page.ipynb.

How to use this Sci1Page? Please refer to the example_Sci1Page.ipynb.

Basically, import the function, use help() function to identify the input parameters
