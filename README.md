Sci1Page repository consists of comprehensive functions for plotting published figures.

Based on the jupyter notebook, you can plot figures or analyze your data, keeping track of the research progress.

This makes it easier to make the figures styles consistent, also easier to replot the figures if necessary.

The functions will include:

1. XRD patterens
2. time resolved photoluminescenceb (TRPL)
3. PL emission
4. SKPM
5. Solar cell devcice parameters extraction (Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE)
6. box plot

and many more (will be included as they are done)......
